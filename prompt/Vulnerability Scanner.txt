Vulnerability Scanner & Tracker
Automated vulnerability management system that scans network infrastructure with Nmap, OpenVAS, and custom Python scripts. Generates detailed reports, tracks remediation progress, and integrates with ticketing systems.

Project Name Suggestion: VulnTrack Pro (or ShadowScan / RedForge / BreachTracker)
Tech Stack (Confirmed)

Backend: Python 3.11+ (Kali default)
Web Framework: Flask + Flask-RESTful
Scanning Engines:
Nmap (via python-nmap or subprocess)
OpenVAS (via python-gvm over GMP)
Custom Python exploit/check scripts

Database: SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (production-ready)
Frontend: HTML5 + Tailwind CSS + Alpine.js (lightweight, no React bloat) or HTMX + Jinja2
Charts: Chart.js + chartjs-plugin-datalabels
Real-time: Flask-SocketIO for live scan progress
Auth: Flask-Login + bcrypt
Reports: PDF (WeasyPrint) + CSV/JSON export
Ticketing Integration: Jira, ServiceNow, or simple email/webhook

Feature Breakdown (Prioritized)
Core Features (Must Have – MVP)

Target Management
Add/Import targets (single IP, range, CIDR, hostname, CSV import)
Target groups/projects

Scanning Engine
Quick Nmap port scan (-sV -O --top-ports 1000 -T4)
Full Nmap script scan (vuln + version)
OpenVAS full authenticated/unauthenticated scan (via python-gvm)
Scheduled scans (cron or APScheduler)

Vulnerability Database & Tracking
Automatic deduplication of findings
Risk scoring (CVSS v3.1 base + temporal)
Status tracking: Open → In Progress → Fixed → False Positive → Risk Accepted
Assignee & due dates

Dashboard
Total vulns by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
Top 10 vulnerable hosts
Vulnerabilities over time chart
Open vs Closed trend

Reporting
Executive PDF report (with charts)
Technical findings export (CSV/JSON)


Good to Have (Phase 2 – Makes it Awesome)

Live Scan Progress
Real-time progress bar with ETA
Live output log streaming via WebSocket
Cancel running scans

Beautiful Dark Theme UI
Cyberpunk/neon design (like HackTheBox or TryHackMe)
Animated severity badges (glowing red for Critical)
Vulnerability heatmap by subnet
Risk score gauge charts

Remediation Playbooks
Pre-written fix suggestions per CVE/common vuln
One-click copy remediation commands

Ticketing Integration
Auto-create Jira/ServiceNow tickets on Critical/High
Sync status back (bidirectional)

Notifications
Email/Slack/Discord webhook on new Critical vulns

Custom Scripts Integration
Upload and run your own Python check scripts per target
Example: Check for Log4Shell, specific misconfigs, etc.

Asset Inventory Enrichment
Auto-banner grabbing + OS CPE detection
Banner-based service fingerprinting


Totally Optional (Phase 3 – God Mode)

Exploit integration (Metasploit RPC or simple PoC launcher)
CVE lookup with live exploit-db, Nuclei templates
SSO (OAuth2 / OIDC)
Multi-user RBAC
API for automation (CI/CD integration)
Vulnerability trend prediction (simple ML)
Dark mode / Light mode toggle
